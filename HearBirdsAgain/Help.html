      <b><i>Hear Birds Again</i></b> is a mobile application for
      bird enthusiasts who can no longer hear high-pitched bird songs,
      but who still have reasonably good hearing in the lower range.
      In brief, it works by lowering high-pitched songs into a range
      where they can be heard.

    <h2>Will <i>Hear Birds Again</i> Help You?</h2>
          
    <p>
      We strongly advise having your hearing tested by an audiologist
      and obtaining and audiogram, so that you know the frequencies at
      which your hearing becomes impaired. You may also visit
      <a href="https://www.starkey.com/online-hearing-test#!/HearingTestLandingPrimary#HearingTestApp">
      this website</a> to test your hearing online.

      It will also be informative to check out the
      <a href="https://hearbirdsagain.org/hear-for-yourself/">
      audio examples</a> on our website where bird songs are played at
      normal pitch followed by pitch-lowered examples.
