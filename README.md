# Hear Birds Again

***Hear Birds Again*** is an open-source, real-time, audio pitch-shifting
application for iOS. It is intended for use primarily by bird enthusiasts
who can no longer hear high-pitched bird sounds.

The initial version of the app uses a simple time-domain overlap-add (OLA)
pitch-shifting algorithm. A forthcoming version will use a more sophisticated
frequency-domain algorithm such as the phase vocoder.
