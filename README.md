# Hear Birds Again

*Hear Birds Again* is a real-time audio pitch shifting application for iOS.
It is intended primarily for field use by bird enthusiasts who can no longer
hear high-pitched bird sounds. It shifts high-pitched sounds down into a lower
pitch range so they can be heard.

The initial version of the app uses a simple time domain overlap-add (OLA)
pitch shifting algorithm. A subsequent version will use a more sophisticated
frequency domain algorithm.

*Hear Birds Again* is a project of the nonprofit
[Miracle of Nature](https://miracleofnature.org), and was developed by
Lang Elliott and Harold Mills. It is not yet available on the Apple App Store,
but we plan to submit it soon.
