# Hear Birds Again

Hear Birds Again is a real-time audio pitch shifting application for iOS.
It is intended primarily for field use by bird enthusiasts who can no longer
hear high-pitched bird sounds.

The initial version of the app uses a simple time domain overlap-add (OLA)
pitch shifting algorithm. A forthcoming version will use a more sophisticated
frequency domain algorithm.

Hear Birds Again is not available on the Apple App Store.
