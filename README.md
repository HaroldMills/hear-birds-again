# Hear Birds Again

*Hear Birds Again* is a real-time audio pitch shifting application for iOS.
It is intended primarily for field use by bird enthusiasts who can no longer
hear high-pitched bird sounds. It shifts high-pitched sounds down into a lower
pitch range so they can be heard.

The initial version of the app uses a simple time domain overlap-add (OLA)
pitch shifting algorithm. A subsequent version will use a more sophisticated
frequency domain algorithm.

The app is distributed via Apple's [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hear-birds-again/id6444369779?platform=iphone).

*Hear Birds Again* is a project of the nonprofit
[Miracle of Nature](https://miracleofnature.org), and was developed by
Lang Elliott and Harold Mills. For more about the app, please see
